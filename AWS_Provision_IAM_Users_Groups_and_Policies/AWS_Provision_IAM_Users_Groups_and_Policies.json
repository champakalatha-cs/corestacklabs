The groups each have different IAM policies associated with them. Note: This example also creates an AWSAccessKeyId/AWSSecretKey pair associated with the new user. The example is somewhat contrived since it creates all of the users and groups, typically you would be creating policies, users and/or groups that contain referemces to existing users or groups in your environment.",
